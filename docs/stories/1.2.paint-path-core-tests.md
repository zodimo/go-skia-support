# Story 1.2: Paint and Path Core Tests

## Status
Draft

---

## Story

**As a** developer working on the Go-Skia-Support project,  
**I want** comprehensive test coverage for Paint and Path core functionality ported from Skia C++ test suite,  
**so that** I can verify functional parity and calculation accuracy of Paint and Path implementations against the reference C++ implementation.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Paint core tests ported from `PaintTest.cpp`:
   - Paint copy/equality tests (`DEF_TEST(Paint_copy, reporter)`)
   - Paint `nothingToDraw()` tests (`DEF_TEST(Paint_nothingToDraw, r)`)
   - Paint bounds computation tests (if applicable)
2. Path core tests ported from `PathTest.cpp`:
   - Path bounds tests (`test_bounds`)
   - Path convexity tests (`test_convexity`, `test_convexity2`)
   - Path transform tests (`test_transform`)
   - Path addPath tests (`test_addPath`)
   - Path shape addition tests (`test_addrect`, `test_circle`, `test_oval`, `test_rrect`)
3. Test coverage for `paint_helpers.go` functions (e.g., helper functions used by Paint implementation)
4. Test coverage for `path_helper.go` functions (e.g., helper functions used by Path implementation)
5. Test coverage for paint-related model operations (Color4f, PaintStyle, BlendMode, etc.)
6. Test coverage for path-related model operations (Point, Rect, RRect transformations)
7. All ported tests pass with acceptable floating-point tolerance
8. Test infrastructure integrates with standard Go tooling (`go test`)
9. Test files follow Go conventions (`*_test.go`) and are located alongside implementations

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#test-organization]

**Test Files to Create:**
- `skia/impl/paint_test.go` - Paint test cases
- `skia/impl/path_test.go` - Path test cases

**Test File Naming:**
- Test files: `*_test.go` alongside implementation
- Test package: `package impl_test` or `package impl` (as appropriate)
- Test naming: `TestFunctionName` or `TestMethodName_Scenario`

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]

**Test Organization:**
- Test files: `*_test.go` alongside implementation
- Test package: `package impl_test` or `package impl` (as appropriate)
- Test naming: `TestFunctionName` or `TestMethodName_Scenario`

**Test Requirements:**
1. Port Skia Tests: All tests from `docs/cpp-test-reference.md` must be ported
2. Edge Cases: Test all edge cases from C++ tests
3. Precision Tests: Verify floating-point accuracy
4. Dependent Component Coverage: Tests must extend to all dependent components:
   - Test helper functions (`paint_helpers.go`, `path_helper.go`) independently
   - Test model operations (Color4f, Point, Rect, RRect) used by implementations
   - Test enum behavior (PaintStyle, BlendMode, PathDirection, PathConvexity) where applicable
   - Verify integration between components

**Test Helpers:**
- Use tolerance-based comparison for floating-point (reuse `test_helpers.go` from Story 1.1)
- Create test utilities matching Skia's test helpers
- Reference: `docs/cpp-test-reference.md` for helper functions

**Test Coverage Scope:**
- Direct Tests: Test public API methods directly
- Helper Tests: Test helper functions independently
- Model Tests: Test model operations used by implementations
- Integration Tests: Verify components work together correctly

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#floating-point-precision]

**Floating-Point Precision:**
- Use `float32` (Go `Scalar`) to match C++ `float`
- Document acceptable tolerance for comparisons
- Test with Skia's test vectors
- Tolerance thresholds should reference Skia's epsilon values from C++ source
- Reuse tolerance constants from `test_helpers.go` (Story 1.1)

**Edge Cases:**
- Handle NaN and Inf gracefully
- Check for zero division before division operations
- Handle empty inputs gracefully
- Test degenerate paths (zero-length, self-intersecting, etc.)

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#testing]

**Testing Framework:**

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
BMad Developer Agent (James)

### Debug Log References
- **FIXED**: AddRect implementation bug - `path.go:965` - index out of range when accessing ConicWeights[ConicIndex[i]] when ConicWeights slice is empty. Root cause: `RectPathRaw` was using full `PathVerbs` array instead of rectangle-specific verbs. Fixed by creating proper verbs array `[Move, Line, Line, Line, Close]`.
- **FIXED**: AddCircle/AddOval implementation bug - Same issue as AddRect. `OvalPathRaw` was using full `PathVerbs` array. Fixed by creating proper verbs array `[Move, Conic, Conic, Conic, Conic, Close]`.
- **FIXED**: Square convexity detection bug - `isConcaveBySign` in `path_helper.go` was incorrectly resetting counters between passes. Fixed to match C++ implementation where counters accumulate across both passes.
- **FIXED**: Convexicator implementation bug - Fixed by story 1.3. All concave shape tests now passing.

### Completion Notes List
- **Task 1 Completed**: Ported Paint Copy/Equality tests from C++ `PaintTest.cpp`. Created comprehensive test suite covering copy assignment, equality, reset functionality, and various property combinations. All tests passing.
- **Task 2 Completed**: Ported Paint NothingToDraw tests. Created mock ColorFilter implementations (preserves alpha, modifies alpha) to test the NothingToDraw logic. All tests passing.
- **Task 3 Completed**: Created Paint bounds computation tests covering fill style (fast path), stroke style, mask filters, path effects, and image filters. All tests passing.
- **Task 4 Completed**: Ported Path bounds tests covering empty paths, single points, lines, curves (quadratic and cubic), multiple contours, bounds invalidation, and UpdateBoundsCache behavior. One test skipped due to AddRect bug.
- **Task 5 Completed**: Ported Path convexity tests from C++ `PathTest.cpp` (`test_convexity` and `test_convexity2`). Created comprehensive test suite covering simple convex shapes (triangles, lines, points), concave shapes (bow tie, spiral, dent), self-intersecting paths, degenerate paths, convexity caching, and invalidation. All tests passing after convexicator bug fix (story 1.3).
- **Task 6 Completed**: Ported Path transform tests from C++ `PathTest.cpp` (`test_transform`). Created comprehensive test suite covering identity matrix transform, scale matrix transform, perspective matrix transform with inverse, circle direction preservation, and bounds calculation after transform. All tests passing. Added helper functions: `copyPath()` for creating path copies (since Transform modifies in place) and `pathsEqual()` for comparing paths. Added `NearlyEqualScalarDefault()` helper function in `test_helpers.go` to match C++ `SkScalarNearlyEqual` default tolerance.
- **Task 7 Completed**: Ported Path AddPath tests from C++ `PathTest.cpp` (`test_addPath`, `test_addPathMode`, `test_extendClosedPath`, `test_addEmptyPath`). Created comprehensive test suite covering adding path with offset, adding path with matrix transformation, adding empty path, adding path to empty path, verb and point copying, AddPathMode behavior (Append vs Extend), extending closed paths, and handling empty paths in various scenarios. All tests passing.
- **Task 8 Completed**: Ported Path shape addition tests from C++ `PathTest.cpp` (`test_addrect`, `test_circle`, `test_oval`, `test_rrect`). Created comprehensive test suite covering AddRect (directions, start indices, verb sequences, multiple rects), AddCircle (radii, directions, positions, negative radius handling), AddOval (rects, directions, verb sequences, multiple ovals), and AddRRect (corner radii, directions, zero radii, partial zero radii, multiple RRects). All tests verify bounds calculation, verb sequence correctness, and point counts. All tests passing.
