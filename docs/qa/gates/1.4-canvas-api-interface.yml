gate: PASS
status_reason: "All QA fixes applied successfully. ClipOp enum now matches C++ SkClipOp API exactly (only kDifference=0 and kIntersect=1). Interface definition is complete, well-documented, and maintains full API parity with C++ Skia."

  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Interface definition only - no security concerns. Interface design supports secure backend implementations."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Interface design is minimal and efficient. Performance characteristics depend on backend implementation."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "ClipOp enum now matches C++ SkClipOp exactly. API parity restored. No reliability concerns."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent documentation with C++ source references, clear method documentation, and usage examples. Code follows Go conventions. Clarifying comment added to ClipOp enum distinguishing SkClipOp from SkPathOp."

    description: "Removed ClipOpUnion, ClipOpXOR, and ClipOpReverseDifference from ClipOp enum. Enum now matches C++ SkClipOp exactly (only kDifference=0 and kIntersect=1). Updated canvas.go documentation to remove references to removed operations. Added clarifying comment distinguishing SkClipOp from SkPathOp."
    verification: "Verified against C++ source include/core/SkClipOp.h. No references to removed enum values found in codebase. All tests pass. Code compiles successfully."
